## The game rules:
Random 4-digit number is generated. This number contains different digits from 0 to 9. The main goal is to guess the number.
If input number contains a digit from generated number, but not in the right place - it is a cow.  
Else if input number contains a digit from generated number, and is in the right place - it is a bull.
The game takes maximum 10 turns, but it may end earlier if guess is right (4 bulls).

e.g.  
generated number is *8413*  
user input: *1402* - *1* bull & *1* cow (as digit *'1'* is represented in generated number as well as in the user input but in incorrect order, and digit *'4'* is both represented and in the right place)
